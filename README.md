# Soil Moisture Prediction using Deep Learning

This repository contains the code and data to predict soil moisture using a deep learning model. 
The prediction is based on the provided dataset, and it utilizes a Jupyter Notebook for model training and evaluation. 
The dataset includes two important files: `bestmodel1` (pre-trained model weights) and `soil` (data file).

To run the prediction model, follow the steps below:

## Steps to Run

1. **Upload Files to Google Drive:**
   - Upload all three files (`soil moisture.ipynb`, `bestmodel1`, and `soil`) to your Google Drive in a dedicated folder.

2. **Open the Jupyter Notebook in Google Colab:**
   - Open Google Colab in your web browser.
   - Click on "File" > "Open Notebook..."
   - Choose the "Upload" tab and upload the `soil moisture.ipynb` notebook from your Google Drive folder.

3. **Mount Google Drive:**
   - In the first cell of the notebook, there should be a code snippet to mount your Google Drive. This will grant the notebook access to the uploaded files.

4. **Adjust File Paths (if needed):**
   - If the notebook references file paths, ensure that they match the folder structure in your Google Drive.

5. **Run the Notebook:**
   - Execute each cell in the Jupyter Notebook sequentially.
   - If necessary, modify any hyperparameters or configurations according to your needs.

6. **View Results:**
   - As the notebook runs, it will perform soil moisture prediction using the pre-trained model.
   - Results, visualizations, and any relevant metrics will be displayed within the notebook.

7. **Interpretation and Further Work:**
   - After running the notebook, analyze the results and assess the model's performance.
   - Consider experimenting with different model architectures, hyperparameters, or preprocessing techniques to improve predictions.


## Important Notes

- Ensure you have a stable internet connection to access Google Colab and your Google Drive.

- Feel free to customize the notebook to your requirements, including visualization, model architecture, and evaluation techniques.

- If you encounter any issues related to file paths, libraries, or dependencies, make sure to resolve them before running the notebook.
